# Spotify Clone ðŸŽµ

This project is a front-end clone of the popular music streaming service Spotify. It replicates the look and feel of the Spotify platform's web interface using only HTML and CSS. No JavaScript was used in this clone, so it focuses entirely on the visual and layout aspects rather than interactive functionality.

Purpose & Learning Outcome ðŸ“š
This Spotify clone project helped enhance my skills in front-end web development and CSS styling. By replicating a complex, real-world UI, I gained valuable experience in structuring and styling components for a modern web application interface. This project also improved my understanding of layout techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid.
